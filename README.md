# STAT 311 Probability Assignments

This repository contains solutions to probability and statistics homework assignments for STAT 311, implemented in R.

## Assignment 3 Overview

Programming Assignment 3 covers three main areas of probability theory:

### Question 1: Discrete Probability with Ball Drawing
- Basic probability calculations with colored balls (red, blue, green)
- Sampling with and without replacement
- Combinatorics and arrangement counting
- Extension problems with additional colored balls

### Question 2: Continuous Probability - Triangular Distribution
- Working with a triangular probability distribution on [0,5] peaking at x=3
- Calculating probability density function height
- Computing cumulative distribution areas
- Conditional probability with truncated distributions
- Probability calculations involving transformations

### Question 3: Conditional Probability - Movie Preferences
- Real-world application using streaming service user data
- Conditional probability calculations
- Independence testing
- Comparing conditional vs marginal probabilities

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

- **Discrete Probability**: Basic probability rules, combinations, permutations
- **Continuous Distributions**: Triangular distribution, area calculations, CDF
- **Conditional Probability**: Bayes' theorem applications, independence
- **R Programming**: Function creation, variable manipulation, logical operations

## Files

- `STAT311-HW3.R` - Complete solution with all questions answered
- Assignment includes both straightforward problems and "hidden answer" questions requiring careful analysis

## Usage

1. Load the R file in RStudio or R console
2. Run the entire script to generate all answers
3. Variables are automatically assigned based on problem requirements
4. Solutions work with randomly generated ball counts (red, blue, green variables)

## Technical Notes

- Solutions use symbolic variables rather than hard-coded numbers for flexibility
- Code follows assignment requirements (no plotting functions in final submission)
- All probability calculations are exact, not approximations
- Functions are designed for reusability and mathematical accuracy

## Topics Covered

- Probability mass functions and density functions
- Cumulative distribution functions
- Conditional probability and Bayes' theorem
- Combinatorics and counting principles
- Geometric probability
- Statistical independence
